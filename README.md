This is a console-based C++ application that enables users to perform three basic file operations: write, append, and read. Users can input the file name, then select actions from a menu.

Write Mode → Creates or overwrites the file with new data.

Append Mode → Adds new data without deleting previous content.

Read Mode → Displays the file’s contents line by line.

The program uses error handling to check if files open successfully and employs cin.ignore() with getline() to handle multi-word input.

Compiler: GCC / g++

Libraries: <iostream> (input/output), <fstream> (file handling), <string> (string operations)
